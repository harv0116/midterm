**Description:** This Android App project tests your ability to use the Cordova Contacts api, Touch events, and the Google Maps Javascript API.

The app will have two screens: a contact list; a dynamic map. After both the DOMContentLoaded and deviceready events have fired, your app should read all the contacts from the device / emulator AND fetch the user's current gps position.

- tested on the Samsung Galaxy S4
